## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a tool (“framework”) for making web pages look good.  
It uses short **classes** in your HTML code to control colors, sizes, spacing, and much more—without writing separate CSS files!

---

## Step 1: Make Sure Tailwind is Installed

Ask your teacher if Tailwind is already set up, or follow [Tailwind Installation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

For beginner projects, you might see a line like this in your HTML:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com" rel="stylesheet">
```

This makes Tailwind available for you!

## Step 2: Style Elements with Tailwind Classes

In your HTML, add classes like `bg-blue-500`, `text-white`, `p-4`.

**Example: Styling a Button**

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
```

**What do the classes mean?**
- `bg-blue-500`: Background color = blue
- `text-white`: Text color = white
- `p-2`: Padding (space inside the button)
- `rounded`: Rounded corners

---

## Step 3: Common Tailwind Classes

- **Colors:**  
  `bg-red-500`, `bg-green-200`, `text-gray-900`, `border-blue-300`
- **Spacing:**  
  `p-4` (padding), `m-2` (margin), `px-6` (padding left/right), `py-2` (padding top/bottom)
- **Size:**  
  `w-1/2` (width half), `h-10` (height)
- **Borders/Rounding:**  
  `border`, `border-2`, `rounded`, `rounded-lg`
- **Text / Font:**  
  `text-xl` (extra large), `font-bold`
- **Flex / Grid:**  
  `flex`, `items-center`, `justify-between`, `grid`, `gap-4`

## Step 4: Example: Making a Card

```html
<div class="bg-white shadow-lg p-6 rounded-lg w-64">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Student Project</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700">This is a simple card using Tailwind.</p>
  <button class="bg-green-500 px-4 py-2 text-white rounded mt-4">Go!</button>
</div>
```

---

## Step 5: Try It Out!

- Change colors (use different `bg-...` classes)
- Adjust padding/margin (`p-8`, `m-4`)
- Make images rounded (`class="rounded-full"`)
- Use layout classes like `flex`, `items-center`, `justify-center`

---

## Summary

- Tailwind lets you style HTML by adding simple class names
- You can quickly change colors, spacing, and layout
- Practice by building a colorful button or card!
