# HOWTO: Use APIs to Get Data from Other Websites

*For beginner programmers (students)*  
*Example language: Python*

---

## What is an API?

An **API** (Application Programming Interface) lets your program talk to another website or app and get data (such as weather, news, or jokes).  
Example: Your program gets today’s weather from a weather API instead of typing it yourself.

---

## Step 1: Find an API

Choose a website that offers an API.  
Look for “API documentation” or “developers” section on a site you like.

Example public APIs (no login required):
- [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) (weather info)
- [Cat Facts](https://catfact.ninja/) (fun cat facts)
- [JokeAPI](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/) (funny jokes)
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) (Pokémon info)

---

## Step 2: Check How to Use the API

- See what kind of info it gives you (read the docs).
- Find out the URL you use to get data.
- Many APIs use URLs like this:  
  `https://api.example.com/data`
- Some APIs need an **API key** (like a password). For now, use one that doesn’t, or ask your teacher how to get a key.

---

## Step 3: Get Data from the API (Python Example)

Let’s use **Cat Facts** as an example.

### 1. Import the requests library

```python
import requests
```

### 2. Use requests to get data

```python
response = requests.get("https://catfact.ninja/fact")
```

### 3. Check the result (called JSON)

```python
data = response.json()
print(data)
```

**You’ll see something like:**  
```python
{'fact': 'Cats sleep 70% of their lives.', 'length': 29}
```

### 4. Use the data in your program

```python
print("Did you know?")
print(data['fact'])  # shows just the cat fact!
```

---

## Step 4: Try a Different API

Change the URL to use other APIs.  
For example, get a joke:

```python
response = requests.get("https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any?type=single")
data = response.json()
print(data['joke'])  # shows a joke
```

---

## Step 5: Handle Errors

Sometimes things go wrong (like network problems or a broken URL).  
Add a check:

```python
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(data['fact'])
else:
    print("Oops! Something went wrong.")
```

---

## Step 6: Practice and Explore

Try:
- Showing five cat facts
- Getting weather from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- Printing three Pokémon names from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

---

## Summary

- APIs help you get data from other websites automatically.
- Use the requests library in Python to ask for data and use `.json()` to handle the answer.
- Practice with different APIs and uses.
