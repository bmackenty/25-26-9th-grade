# Flask Learning Projects for 9th Grade Students

A collection of Flask web applications designed to teach students web development fundamentals through hands-on projects. The projects are templates designed to be modified for a real-world problems. 
##  Learning Objectives

Students will learn:
- **Flask Framework**: Routing, request handling, and response generation
- **Jinja2 Templating**: Dynamic HTML generation and template inheritance
- **SQLite Databases**: CRUD operations and data relationships
- **User Authentication**: Login systems and session management
- **Modern Web Development**: HTML forms, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity

## Project 1: CRUD Application

**Difficulty Level**: Beginner  
**Concepts Covered**: Basic Flask, Jinja templating, SQLite CRUD operations

### What You'll Build
A simple item management system where users can:
- Create new items with names and descriptions
- View a list of all items
- Edit existing items
- Delete items
- Search through items

### Key Learning Points
- Flask route handling (GET/POST)
- Jinja template inheritance and blocks
- SQLite database operations
- Form processing and validation
- Basic user interface with Tailwind CSS

### Setup Instructions
```bash
cd 01-crud-app
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## 🎫 Project 2: Help Desk System

**Difficulty Level**: Intermediate  
**Concepts Covered**: Advanced Flask, user roles, complex database relationships

### What You'll Build
A help desk ticket management system where:
- Users can submit support tickets
- Support agents can manage and respond to tickets
- Admins can oversee the entire system
- Tickets have statuses, priorities, and categories

### Key Learning Points
- User authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control
- Complex database relationships
- Advanced Jinja templating
- Form validation and error handling

### Setup Instructions
```bash
cd 02-helpdesk-system
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### First Time Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/25-26-9th-grade.git
cd 25-26-9th-grade

# Set up the first project
cd 01-crud-app
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate          # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Make your changes to the code
# Test your application
python app.py

# When ready to save changes
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push origin main
```

### Template Inheritance
- **base.html**: Contains common layout, navigation, and styling
- **Child templates**: Extend base.html and fill in content blocks
- **Includes**: Reusable components like navigation menus

### Database Design
- **SQLite tables**: Simple, file-based database
- **CRUD operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **Relationships**: Foreign keys between related tables
